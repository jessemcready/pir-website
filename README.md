# pir-website
Web application to sketch sidewalks
Made with the help of the repository over at https://github.com/chrispalmeri/really-sketch

Available online, hosted by Heroku, at https://pirwebsite.herokuapp.com/.

After cloned, change directories and npm install to get all dependencies.  Then run npm run bundle-js to run browserify on script.js so we can use nodemailer soon.  Finally, run "npm start" and once your terminal says "Listening on PORT: 5000" you can open up web browser and navigate to localhost:5000 . Made to run optimally on iPads since that is the only device that will be running this.
